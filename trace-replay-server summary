TraceReplayHelper installs TraceReplayClient on each client and corresponding TraceReplayServer, for each connection.

Step wise explanation from trace-replay-helper.cc

STEP 1
This code in trace-replay-helper initializes the TraceReplayServer Object.
Ptr<TraceReplayServer> server = CreateObject<TraceReplayServer> ();

The Trace Replay Server's constructor is called when the object is created and the following variables are initialized:
  m_socket = 0;
  m_connected = false;
  m_totRecByte = 0;
  m_totExpByte = 0;
  m_totByteCount = 0;
  


STEP 2
The next thing in the trace-replay-example is:
server->SetConnectionId (ipClient, portClient, ipServer, portServer);

TraceReplayServer::SetConnectionId (Address ipClient, uint16_t portClient, Address ipServer, uint16_t portServer)
{
  NS_LOG_FUNCTION (this);
  m_ipClient = ipClient;
  m_ipServer = ipServer;
  m_portClient = portClient;
  m_portServer = portServer;
}
This initializes the real IP address of client and server and real port numbers of client and server.  


STEP 3
server->Setup (address, m_dataRate, numRep, expByte, packetList);
