The uploaded files with prefix 'd' followed by a number are the graphs of number of kilobytes per second 
obtained by running 20 pcap files. 

The blue dots signify the kilobytes per second traffic for input pcap file(which was captured through the experiment).
Green dots signify the kilobytes per second traffic for output pcap file(the one obtained after running the trace replay
application using the input pcap file as input).
