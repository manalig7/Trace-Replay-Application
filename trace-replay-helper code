m_startTimeJitter = CreateObject<UniformRandomVariable> ();
###The uniform distribution Random Number Generator (RNG).
This class supports the creation of objects that return random numbers from a fixed uniform distribution. It also supports the generation of single random numbers from various uniform distributions.
The output range is $[min, max)$ for floating point values, (max excluded), and $[min, max]$ (max included) for integral values.###

setstream();
###stream--->
Stream: The stream number for this RNG stream. -1 means "allocate a stream automatically". Note that if -1 is set, Get will return -1 so that it is not possible to know which value was automatically allocated.
Set with class: ns3::IntegerValue
Underlying type: int64_t -9223372036854775808:9223372036854775807
Initial value: -1
Flags: construct write read
###

VAR.c_str()
###Returns a pointer to an array that contains a null-terminated sequence
of characters (i.e., a C-string) representing the current value of the string object.###

system()
###Invokes the command processor to execute a command.###
