m_parallelConnList => is the parallel connection vector of the struct ParallelConnectionInfo (declared in trace-replay-utility.h)
The struct ParallelConnectionInfo contains the source port, destination port and the byte count.


TraceReplayPacket => Initializes the packet with delay = 0 and size = 0

GetByteCount => Gets the byte count of that particular parallel connection. We can either give the connection index or the source and destination port number

GetNumParallelConnection => The total number of parallel connections

GetConnectionId => Actually returns the source destination port taking the connection id/index number(vector) as input

AddParallelConnection => Makes a new parallel connection taking the byte count, source port and destination port

GetDelay, SetDelay, GetSize, SetSize => Returns and sets the delay and the size of the packet
