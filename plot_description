Steps for plotting the traffic graphs:

1. Collect the input pcap file and the output pcap file(the one obtained after running the trace replay application
with input pcap file)
2. Convert both input pcap and output pcap to csv files by using the 'Export Packet Dissections' option in Wireshark.
3. Remove the first line in the csv file, remove " and replace , with space.
4. Run the reader.awk file with the modified csv files as output and write the output to respective txt files.
5. Remove the last line from the txt files.
6. Give these txt files as input to plot.py and plot the graphs.
